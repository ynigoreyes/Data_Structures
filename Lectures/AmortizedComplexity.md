# Amortized Complexity
- NP-Complete: Nondeterministic Polynomial
  - NP-Complete is a subset of NP-Hard
  - These are solvable problems that take way too long to solve
  - Cannot determine how long it will take to solve
  - intractable: Cannot be be solved in a reasonable amount of time
  - Reduction
    - Travelling Salesman
    - Hamiltonian Path
    - Knapsack Problem
